# THE-S.U.C.K.-PROTOCOL
Today marks a milestone for the **Secret Unlocked Circle of FortKnight's**. After countless hours of research, testing, and relentless refinement, I present to you the ultimate tool for competitive gaming:

## **THE S.U.C.K. PROTOCOL**
*A FortKnight's Legacy by JACKPOT_ZB*

This is not just another "network tweak." This is a deep, aggressive protocol engineered to extract the absolute **lowest possible latency** and the **most stable connection** from your system. No more fumbling through hundreds of settings. One clickâ€”it's all done.

### :zap: **What It Does:**

*   **Aggressive Latency Tuning:** Strips the Windows network stack of all unnecessary overhead for minimum ping and jitter.
*   **Direct Hardware Control:** Seizes control of your network adapter for optimal interrupt handling on a dedicated CPU core (Core 1).
*   **Realtek Specialization:** Contains exclusive registry modifications crafted specifically for Realtek gaming drivers, including critical settings like `PacketDirect` and `CLKREQ`.
*   **Permanent Optimization:** Anchors critical settings via a scheduled task that runs at every system boot, making the tweaks driver-update-proof.
*   **Intelligent Automation:** Automatically finds the optimal MTU for your connection and sets the Interface Metric to `1`, ensuring your gaming adapter always has top priority.
*   **Total Power Management Override:** Forces your adapter to run at 100% performance, 100% of the time. All green ethernet and power-saving features are eliminated.

### :warning: **READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING:**

*   **DESKTOP PCs ONLY:** This protocol is designed for stationary gaming rigs on a **wired (Ethernet)** connection.
*   **EXCLUSIVE TO REALTEK:** It is aggressively optimized for **Realtek network chips**. While it may not harm other adapters, it won't have the full intended effect.
*   **NOT FOR LAPTOPS OR WI-FI:** Running this on a laptop or over a Wi-Fi connection will likely cause issues, as it disables all power-saving mechanisms essential for mobile hardware.
*   **RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR:** You **must** right-click the `.ps1` file and "Run with PowerShell" to grant it the necessary administrative rights.
